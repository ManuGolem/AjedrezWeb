# Chess Clone - React Implementation

A simplified single-player chess application inspired by chess.com, built with React and CSS to practice core game mechanics.

## Features

- **Complete Chess Rules**: 
  - Piece movement (including special moves like castling & en passant)
  - Check/checkmate detection
  - Turn management
- **Move Notation**:
  - Algebraic notation logging
  - Move history tracking
- **Game State Management**:
  - Captured pieces tracking
  - Game status indicators (check, game over)

## Tech Stack

- React 
- Pure CSS for the styles 
- Chess logic implemented from scratch (maybe not the best)

## Disclaimer

This is an educational project not affiliated with chess.com. All chess rules/logic were implemented independently for learning purposes.
## Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement game timer
- [ ] Add difficulty levels vs AI
- [ ] Save game state locally
